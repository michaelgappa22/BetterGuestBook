# BetterGuestBook
Module 4 Project Assignment

This is a project I've developed to further develop my skills in C#. I've created this Console application to take in guest names, birthday, email, and message to host.

After all data is collected and added to the Guest list, the console will loop through and announce the guests full name and message to host.

I've added a new requirement. If there's a guest who is older than 65, they are escorted with special seating. 

This is a complete from scratch I wrote after following Tim's exmaple project. Feel free to tweak and make changes as needed to better fit the code.
